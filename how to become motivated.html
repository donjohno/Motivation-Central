            <p>
            The thing about motivation is that everyone feels motivated at first, but then our motivation gets tested everyday single day and sometimes, even the next day we fall into our old routines. What we need to do is take actionable steps everyday until the new routine is formed. Only until our routine becomes a habit is when we do not require motivation, the new routine will become autonomous.
