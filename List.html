        <h1>Types of motivation</h1>
        <dl>
            
            <h2><dt>Intrinsic Motivation</dt></h2>
            <dd> Intrinsic motivation states that people are motivated by internal rewards like fulfillment and contentment.</dd>
            
             <h2><dt>Extrinsic Motivation</dt></h2>
            <dd>Extrinsic motivation states that people are motivated by external rewards like a bonus or raise as well as negative external factors like getting fired </dd>
            
            
               <h2><dt>Achievement Motivation</dt></h2>
               <dd>Achievement motivation states that people are driven by the desire to pursue and achieve specific goals. People who are motivated by this type of motivation are driven by the achievement of a task or goal itself, and not necessarily because of the reward that’s attached. <br> For example, an entrepreneur might build a business for the joy of building a world-class organization, and not necessarily because there’s money attached. </dd>
            
             <h2><dt>Incentive Motivation</dt></h2>
               <dd>Incentive motivation, unlike achievement motivation, says that people are motivated more by the reward than by the achievement of the goal itself. Instead of being motivated by the pursuit of a goal or task itself, those who are motivated by incentives are driven to take action because of an expected (and often specific) reward. <br> For example, if you want a promotion because of the higher salary and not because you’ll feel more fulfilled, you are motivated by incentives rather than by achievement.</dd>
            
               <h2><dt>Power Motivation</dt></h2>
              <dd>Power motivation is a motivational factor that says people are motivated by control over our own lives and/or the lives of others. Everyone wants choices, and people are often motivated to increase their overall life-options. For this reason, power motivation manifests itself in the desire to affect the direction of our lives and sometimes the lives of those around us.</dd>
